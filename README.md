I am a sophomore at Kellogg Community College pursuing an Associate degree in Cybersecurity. After completing my associate's, I plan to transfer to Ferris State University to earn a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity. While I don't yet have certifications due to financial circumstances, I have acquired substantial knowledge in areas like A+ and Security+ through my coursework at KCC. Though my professional experience is still developing, I have gained considerable hands-on experience through my education, which I aim to apply in real-world scenarios as I advance in my career.


## Objective

I am currently seeking an internship to apply my skills and gain hands-on experience in the field. My goal is to leverage my academic knowledge and practical experience to contribute effectively to a dynamic IT team while continuing to grow and learn within the industry.
