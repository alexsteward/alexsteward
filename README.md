I am currently a sophomore at Kellogg Community College pursuing an Associate degree in Cybersecurity. After completing my associate's, I plan to transfer to Ferris State University to earn a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity. While I don't yet have certifications due to financial circumstances, I have acquired substantial knowledge in areas like A+ and Security+ through my coursework at KCC. Though my professional experience is still developing, I have gained a lot of hands-on experience through my education, which I aim to apply in real-world scenarios as I advance in my IT career.


## Objective

I am currently seeking an IT internship or part-time position to apply my skills and gain hands-on experience in the field. My goal is to use my academic knowledge and practical experience to contribute to a skilled IT team while continuing to grow and learn within the industry.
